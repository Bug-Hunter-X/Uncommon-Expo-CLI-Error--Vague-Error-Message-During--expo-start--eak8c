# Uncommon Expo CLI Error During Project Start

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI produces a vague error message during the `expo start` command. The error isn't a specific error code but rather a general failure to start, often stemming from configuration issues or dependency conflicts. 

## Problem

The main problem lies in the lack of a clear error message from the Expo CLI.  Debugging involves a process of elimination to find the root cause, as the initial error message doesn't pinpoint the issue. 

## Solution

The solution requires a systematic approach to debugging, starting with a thorough check of `package.json`, followed by dependency reinstallation, and then a review of the project's structure and configuration files (`app.json`, `expo.json`).  Sometimes, even seemingly minor issues like typos or outdated dependencies can cause this type of problem. 

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone the repository. 
2.  Try running `expo start`. (The exact error message will vary but will indicate a failure to start.) 
3.  Follow the steps in the `bugSolution.js` to fix the problem.
