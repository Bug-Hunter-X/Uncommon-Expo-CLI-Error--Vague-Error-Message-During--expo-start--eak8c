The solution focuses on a systematic debugging approach.  There's no single code fix, as the root cause varies. The solution is primarily a guide to resolving the issue:

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Check for typos in dependency names and versions. Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified.
2. **Clean Install:** Delete `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to force a fresh installation of all dependencies.
3. **Inspect `app.json` / `expo.json`:** Carefully review the configuration files for any typos or incorrect settings.
4. **Check Project Structure:** Verify that your project's files and folders are in the correct locations as per Expo's project setup guidelines. 
5. **Update Expo CLI and Dependencies:** Run `npm install -g expo-cli` to update the CLI. Also, consider updating your project's dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` (but be cautious about breaking changes). 
6. **Restart:** Restart your development environment (computer) to ensure no lingering processes interfere. 
7. **Minimal Reproducible Example:** Create a new, minimal Expo project to rule out issues specific to your current project's codebase. Gradually transfer components from your original project to the new one until you pinpoint the problematic code.

By following these steps, you can systematically identify and resolve the root cause of the vague Expo CLI error.
